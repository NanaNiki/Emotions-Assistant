<h2>SPA like app ~ Emotions Assistant ~</h2>

<p>
Emotions Assistant is a application designed to assist users in recognizing and managing their emotions effectively. The app offers a guided step by step process of emotional integration by breathing exercises, emotion notes, space for journaling and helpful resources. Users can select their current mood from a range of options and display notes to provide further context and better understanding. The emotion journal feature provides a platform for users to express and reflect on their emotions, either by free flow of thoughts or prompt with helpful question. In the final step user can get their report of their process in PDF form.</p>
<p>My goal with Emotions Assistant app was to empower users in managing their emotions, providing them with tools and resources to cultivate emotional well-being and self-care.</p>
<p>The whole app from blobs, UX/UI and idea is my original work, inspired by experience as movement teacher ðŸ¥°</p>
